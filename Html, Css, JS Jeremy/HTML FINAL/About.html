        <h3>Ernő Rubik</h3>
        <p>Ernő Rubik (Hungarian: [ˈrubik ˈɛrnøː]; born 13 July 1944) is a Hungarian inventor, architect, and professor
          of
          architecture. He is best known for the invention of mechanical puzzles including the Rubik's Cube (1974),
          Rubik's
          Magic, Rubik's Magic: Master Edition, and Rubik's Snake.[2]. While Rubik became famous for inventing the
          Rubik's
          Cube and his other puzzles, much of his recent work involves the promotion of science in education. Rubik is
          involved with several organizations such as Beyond Rubik's Cube, the Rubik Learning Initiative and the Judit
          Polgar Foundation all of whose aim is to engage students in science, mathematics, and problem solving at a
          young
          age.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ern%C5%91_Rubik">Read More...</a></p>
